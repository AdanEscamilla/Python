Listen up, turn it up and rock it out
Party on, I wanna hear you scream and shout
This is real, as real as it gets
I came to get down to get some fucking respect
Taking it back to hardcore level
You better be ready, put your pedal to the metal
Taking it back to hardcore level
You better be ready, put your pedal to the metal
Go!
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
I want domination
I want your submission
I see you're not resisting
To this temptation
I've got one confession
A love deprivation
I've got a jet black heart
It's all fucked up and it's falling apart
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
I've got another confession
I fell to temptation
And there is no question
There was some connection
I've got to follow my heart
No matter how far
I gotta roll the dice
Never look back and never think twice
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Take your past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on, I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal, you get no respect
You're gonna get yours
You better watch your fucking neck
Take the past, burn it up and let it go
Carry on, I'm stronger than you'll ever know
That's the deal, you get no respect
If you try to get hard you better watch your fuckin' neck
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give up
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in (take your past, burn it up and let it go)
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in
Whoa oh oh oh, I'll never give in (take your past, burn it up and let it go)
I just wanna be, wanna be loved
